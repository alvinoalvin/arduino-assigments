# arduino-assigments

These are my first arduino(microcontroller) programs! 

## A01. 

It's a Traffic Light, with features that every traffic light should have. 

### Features
``` 
  * Blinking yellow lights
  * Different time delays based on Switch combinations 
  * An extra Set of LEDS showing the State. 
``` 

### Improvments to be made

```
 * Use timers so that we can change the delays of each led individually
 * Change the State LEDs to an LCD display or digit display
```
